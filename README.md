## 📁 Project Structure

```

├── assets/

├── components/
│   ├── Header.jsx
│   └── Sidebar.jsx
│
├── layouts/
│   └── AdminLayout.jsx
│
├── pages/
│   ├── admin/
│   │   ├── Dashboard.jsx

└── index.css
```

This structure keeps the project simple and organized:

* `components/` → Reusable layout components like Header and Sidebar
* `layouts/` → Layout wrappers such as AdminLayout
* `pages/admin/` → All admin dashboard pages
* `pages/` → Public pages like Login, Register, and Home
* `assets/` → Static resources (images, GIFs, etc.)

---

## 🔐 Authentication (Static)

Currently:

* Login & Register pages are UI only.
* No backend authentication yet.
* You can manually navigate to:

```
/admin
```

to access the admin dashboard.

Future improvement:

* JWT Authentication
* Protected Routes
* Role-based Access Control

---

## 🧭 Sidebar Features

* Toggle open / close
* Smooth width transition
* Icon-only mode when collapsed
* Active route highlight
* Logout button
* User info section

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

This dashboard is fully responsive:

* Desktop → Full sidebar
* Tablet → Collapsible sidebar
* Mobile → Compact layout

Built using Tailwind’s responsive utilities.

## 🎨 UI Highlights

---

## 🎥 Animated GIF Background

This project uses **animated GIF backgrounds** in both the Header and Sidebar to create a modern and dynamic UI experience.

### Why GIF Background?

* Adds movement and depth to the interface
* Makes the dashboard feel futuristic and alive
* Enhances visual engagement without heavy animation libraries
* Combined with dark overlay (`bg-black/60`, `bg-black/70`) for better readability

### Implementation Strategy

* GIF is placed using `position: absolute`
* Overlay layer added for contrast
* Content wrapped inside `relative z-10`
* Uses `object-cover` for full coverage
* Optimized for responsiveness

This approach keeps the UI modern while maintaining performance and clean structure.

* Database Integration
* Real Authentication System
* Dashboard Charts (Recharts / Chart.js)
